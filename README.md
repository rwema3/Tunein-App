Thank you in advance 👍



## Getting Started 🚀

- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies by running `flutter packages get`
- Run it with `flutter run` or `flutter run -d android` for a specific platform
- You can build using `flutter build --no-tree-shake-icons` : the tree shake icons argument is a temporary thing until a fix is added in the main channel.
